It is optional. Please prioritize the required\ncoursework.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to preparing a portfolio of awesome projects to show off to your\nfuture employer, you'll also need to be prepared for technical interviews. In\nthis part of the course, we'll help you prepare by asking you to solve a series\nof problems on algorithms and/or data structures. You may find some problems\neasy and others incredibly difficult. Don't worry - this is normal. It takes\ntime to get used to solving these types of problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we get into how to approach progressing through this section, let's talk\nabout the two types of technical interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eTwo Types of Technical Interviews\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour technical interview may be held asynchronously or synchronously. During an\nasynchronous technical interview, you may be asked to solve algorithmic problems\nin a timed environment by yourself. For a synchronous interview, you will likely\nbe asked to whiteboard and solve the problem in front of your interviewer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAsync technical interviews typically require candidates to problem solve alone.\nOnce the solution is submitted, the hiring team will review your solution and\ndetermine whether you should move forward in the hiring process. At this point,\nthey'll likely require that most or all problems be solved and will also\nconsider the quality of the solution/s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring synchronous interviews, the interviewer is likely looking to see how you:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWork in a team\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHandle feedback\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTalk technically\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHandle obstacles\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApproach solving a problem / think\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEvaluate different approaches to solving a problem and make decisions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt this stage, you may be able to move forward in the hiring process if you\ndemonstrate good communication skills, logical thinking, perseverance, calm\nunder pressure, and graciousness towards your interviewer's feedback even if you\nare unable to solve the problem. Asking good questions to fully understand the\nproblem or get unstuck are normally welcome. Interviewers also typically expect\nyou to come up with your own test cases to ensure the problem is actually\nsolved. This portion of the interview might require you to largely solve the\nproblem alone on a whiteboard or IDE, or through pair programming where the\ninterviewer is either the driver or navigator. Many interviewers are forgiving\nof syntax errors, and they generally don't expect you to have every piece of the\ncore language memorized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this portion of the course, we will be preparing you for both types of\ninterviews, so it's important to take the time to solve as many problems as you\ncan alone and to complete the paired assignments, if applicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to Progress Through This Section\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recommend approaching these problems in order by yourself since each problem\nincreases in difficulty. For a problem that is meant to be solved on the same\nday, work on it for 30 minutes. If you can't solve it in 30 minutes, work on\nsomething else, and then come back to it and give yourself up to 30 more\nminutes. For problems that are meant to be solved over the course of several\ndays, set aside 30 to 60 minutes each day to work on them. If you reach the time\nlimit and have not solved the problem, look at our solution or someone else's\nand take time to understand why it works. Some days, due to your workload, you\nmay need to set a shorter time limit; we recommend a minimum of 20 minutes\ntotal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you fall behind, e.g. you didn't solve Week 1 Day 2's problem on time, keep\nin mind that we usually have bonus problems and spare time available in Week 3\nof any Phase. You can always use this time to catch up on problems you missed.\nDon't worry if you don't finish all of the problems before the next Phase, you\ncan always come back to them when you have time or even after graduation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor any type of problem, if you were able to pass most of the test cases but\njust can't quite solve a couple of the edge cases, consider looking for a\nsolution to compare yours to. If we provide a solution, you can compare it to\nours, but you can also ask other students and search the Internet. Take the time\nto understand why the solutions work and consider working on your solution until\nit works given what you've learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSome Things to Keep in Mind\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may struggle with some or many of these problems. Be patient with yourself\nand trust that with time and practice, you'll improve. You'll be amazed at how\nmuch you progress with each week or month!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you look at others' solutions, be aware that shorter doesn't mean better. Aim\nfor a solution that makes sense to you, which you can also explain to others.\nThree lines of easy-to-understand code is better than one line of confusing\ncode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you use an online platform that provides information on how fast your code\nruns or how well it utilizes memory, take that information with a giant grain of\nsalt. Many of those platforms do not tell you how they arrive at those results,\nand you may find that the results vary greatly even when running the same code.\nYou might also find that someone with a similar solution to yours has wildly\ndifferent performance results - an indication that the platform isn't\ncalculating results correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, try not to compare yourself to others at this point. Everyone progresses\nat a different pace, and that's OK. The key is to keep trying while taking care\nof yourself mentally and physically.\u003c/p\u003e","exportId":"welcome-to-technical-interview-preparation"},{"id":447635,"title":"Algorithmic Problem Solving","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":"must_view","completed":true,"content":"\u003cdiv id=\"git-data-element\" data-org=\"learn-co-curriculum\" data-repo=\"algorithmic-problem-solving\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cheader class=\"fis-header\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"fis-git-link\" href=\"https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/algorithmic-problem-solving\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg id=\"repo-img\" title=\"Open GitHub Repo\" alt=\"GitHub Repo\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca class=\"fis-git-link\" href=\"https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/algorithmic-problem-solving/issues/new\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg id=\"issue-img\" title=\"Create New Issue\" alt=\"Create New Issue\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eLearning Goals\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelop a process for solving algorithm problems\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn algorithm is just a procedure that solves a problem. If you're wondering if\nthat's any different from the work you've already been doing, we've got good\nnews: It's not!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this reading, we'll go over the importance of solving such problems and how\nto approach coming up with solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Solve Algorithm Problems?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWorking through these challenges will not only help you during the technical\ninterview process, it will also help you become a better programmer. Learning\nhow to break apart a problem into pieces you can understand and then code a\nsolution for is a vital skill, as is learning to think about the different types\nof inputs - or test cases - your solution must account for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you grow as a developer, you'll find yourself leaning on these skills more\nand more, especially as your work becomes more challenging. These skills will\ntruly help you in any and every project you take on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to Solve a Problem\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTwo mistakes many programmers make are to jump into code too fast or to start\nthinking about code optimization too early. Both of these mistakes can greatly\nincrease the amount of time it takes to solve a problem and increase\nfrustration. To avoid this, here are the steps we recommend taking:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e1. Spend Time Understanding the Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you dive into solving the problem, take the time to read it and describe\nit in your own words. You might find it useful to rewrite the problem before\nmoving on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have been given test cases, look at each one, apply your understanding of\nthe problem to them to determine what the answer is, and then check if your\nanswer matches the actual answer (e.g. work it out on paper or in your head, no\ncode necessary here). If your answer doesn't match, you need to spend more time\nunderstanding the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e2. Write Your Own Test Cases\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you understand the problem and why the answers to the test cases are\nwhat they are, you're ready to write your own test cases! We are not\nrecommending that you write test suites in Rspec or Jest. Instead, you simply\nprint the result of calling your solution method and compare it to the answer\nyou expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBe aware that algorithm problem descriptions rarely provide all of the test\ncases you need to account for, so it's incredibly important that you also come\nup with your own. This is true when using online platforms, such as Leetcode and\nHackerRank, as well as during interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e3. Pseudocode\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRemember how we asked you to check your understanding of the problem by going\nthrough the test cases and then writing your own tests? Congratulations! This\nmeans that on some level, you know how to solve the problem. Before you start\ncoding, write pseudocode, which is just a plain description of how to solve the\nproblem. For example, the pseudocode for copying only numbers from one array to\nanother might look like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"highlight plaintext\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003einitialize empty array called result\n\niterate over each item in the input array:\n  if element is a number:\n    push item onto result\n\nreturn result\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that different people write pseudocode differently. The key is to make it\neasy to understand yourself and explain to others - this is the map to the code\nyou're about to write! I often paste my pseudocode into my workspace as\ncomments, and then code each piece alongside the matching comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also test this procedure against the test cases before writing any code.\nValidating and rewriting pseudocode will likely save you time. You might also\nwish to think about additional solutions: there's always more than one way to\nsolve a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e4. Code!\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you have a map, convert it to code!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, the goal is to make it work: pass those test cases! If you're\nhaving a hard time getting all of the test cases working, check that your\npseudocode actually solves for all of those cases and then check that your code\ndoes what the pseudocode says it should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e5. Make It Clean and Readable\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce your solution is well, a solution, it's time to refactor your code so that\nit's easy to read, not just for you but also for others. Use well-named\nvariables and convert blocks of code to methods when necessary. If you find any\nunneeded or redundant code, delete it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDon't forget to test your code again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e6. Optimize?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDon't optimize your code for time or space complexity (e.g. how long it takes to\nrun or how much memory it's using) unless you absolutely need to. There are\nthree major situations that call for optimization:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe solution is hanging on certain test cases, and therefore cannot pass since\nit's taking too long\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou were asked to do so\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou think it would be fun to try\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe hope these steps help you solve the problems you're about to encounter.\nRemember, they can be applied to all types of problems, including building web\napps. Don't be afraid to spend more time thinking and planning than coding. Take\nit from those of us who have been coding for years: we often spend more time\nthinking, talking, and writing than we do coding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we go, we'd like to leave you with some final tips:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTalk to yourself while you code: think out loud\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConsider recording your screen and voice as you solve a problem so you can\nreview your performance\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTake your time and be patient with yourself!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","exportId":"algorithmic-problem-solving"},{"id":447636,"title":"A Note on Testing","type":"WikiPage","indent":0,"locked":false,"requirement":"must_view","completed":true,"content":"\u003cdiv id=\"git-data-element\" data-org=\"learn-co-curriculum\" data-repo=\"note-on-testing\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cheader class=\"fis-header\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"fis-git-link\" href=\"https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/note-on-testing\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg id=\"repo-img\" title=\"Open GitHub Repo\" alt=\"GitHub Repo\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca class=\"fis-git-link\" href=\"https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/note-on-testing/issues/new\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg id=\"issue-img\" title=\"Create New Issue\" alt=\"Create New Issue\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/header\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eLearning Goals\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUse tests to understand your algorithm and discover test cases\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhen To Run Tests\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we have made a test suite available for a problem, please refrain from\nlooking at or running those tests until you have:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePassed the tests given in the README\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePassed the tests you wrote yourself\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis will give you a chance to think through the problem and write your own test\ncases, which is a skill you'll need when interviewing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn some interview settings, you won't have tests provided to confirm that your\nalgorithm meets the specifications.

Explain the\nchallenge to your partner and provide some example test cases. You are not\nexpected to provide every possible test case or edge case. Instead, provide just\nenough detail for the interviewee to understand the problem and ask clarifying\nquestions.

So if it were to receive 'cat', it\nwould return 'tac'.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will also need to answer questions. Your partner might ask you to confirm\ntheir understanding of the problem or whether or not they should handle certain\nedge cases. If you don't know the answer to a question, it's OK to say \"I don't\nknow\" or \"I'll let you decide.\" Sometimes the interviewer doesn't have the\nanswers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNotice when your partner gets stuck and needs a nudge in the right direction.\nProvide helpful tips or hints, but don't give away the answer. Ideally, your\npartner will ask questions when they get stuck, but if you notice that they're\nstruggling with something for a little too long, don't be afraid to give a\nlittle nudge. You can also ask in advance if your partner would like a hint\nbefore providing advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen time is up, provide a constructive review of your partner's performance.\nSome areas to talk about include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProblem explanation: did your partner explain the problem back to you in their\nown words and confirm their understanding before coding?

When providing feedback,\nbe specific, so your partner has an opportunity to improve. Also structure your\nfeedback into two sections. For example, you might talk about what went well and\nthen what can be improved, rather than mixing them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eInstructions for Interviewee\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs the interviewee, your job will be to solve the problem posed by your partner.\nThe interviewer instructions above explain which areas you should focus on in\norder to ace your interview.

We might think about which solution is easier to code or understand,\nbut we could also think about which solution runs faster. That last case is\nwhere Big O notation (calculating time complexity) comes in!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Big O Notation?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBig O notation describes the amount of time it takes for a procedure to run\nrelative to its input. For example, if the input is a string of one character:\nhow long will it take? If the input is 1,000 characters, how long then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt describes the runtime abstractly in terms of the input size and the number of\noperations that will occur, rather than milliseconds or other units of time.\nSpecifically, it describes the way in which the runtime grows as the input\ngrows. Here are some examples of what Big O notation looks like: O(n), O(1),\nO(n\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e). We'll get into what this means in a moment. For now, know that\nn refers to the size of the input or the input itself, e.g. the length of a\nstring or an array or a value itself, such as an integer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eCalculate for the Worst Case\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we get technical, let's use going to the grocery store as an analogy for\ncalculating time complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eGrocery Store\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo we're at the store looking for chocolate chips. The best case is that we walk\nin, and BAM, those chocolate chips are right there in front of us. The worst\ncase is that we end up walking up and down every single aisle, until finally we\nfind them. That last case is what we're interested in, and we could then\ndescribe our chocolate chip search in terms of the number of aisles in the\ngrocery store: O(aisles), because our search time grows as the number of aisles\ngrows. In other words, the amount of time it takes to find chocolatey morsels of\ngoodness depends on the number of aisles in the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there were 5 aisles, we could say O(5), but what if the grocery store added\nor removed aisles? We'd have to update our notation to the new value, e.g.\nO(20). This is why it's better to say O(aisles): it covers any number of aisles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eFinding an Element in an Array\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet's say we have an unsorted array of elements and our function needs to find\nand return a specific element. That element could be at the 0th index or it\ncould be at the last index or not in there at all, so we iterate over the array\nuntil we find it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"highlight plaintext\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003efunction findElement(arr, target):\n  iterate over arr:\n    if element == target:\n      return true\n\n  return false\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe're interested in the worst case, which is when the element is not in the\narray. In that case we must iterate over the entire array before returning\nfalse. We can refer to the number of elements as n, which means Big O for this\nfunction is O(n). The time it takes to run directly relates to the array's\nlength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eCalculate for the Weakest Link\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBig O does not concern itself with every little detail in a procedure. Instead,\nit cares most about the part of the procedure that will take the longest. In\nother words, we find the part that will take the longest (the weakest link) and\ncalculate Big O for that part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eGrocery Store\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet's think back to our chocolate chip hunt. We discussed walking the aisles to\nsearch for those sweet nuggets, but we didn't talk about going to the store or\nwalking home. Let's pretend we live one minute away from the store, so walking\nthere always takes one minute. The time it takes to walk the aisles, on the\nother hand, depends on where the chocolate chips are. We don't need to concern\nourselves with the time it takes to walk because it's not the weakest link: it's\nalways the same amount of time. Walking the aisles is the weakest link because\nit has the potential to take up the most time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eFinding a Duplicate Element in an Array\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet's say we need to check if there's a duplicate of the 0th element in an array\nelsewhere in that same array.

The weakest link is the iteration over the\narray, which depends on the length of the array, so it has the potential to take\nup the most time. If the array is one element long: great, it'll be super fast.\nBut if it contains one million elements, that's going to take some time. Since\nthe amount of time directly correlates with the length of the array (which we\ncall n), Big O for this algorithm is O(n).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDrop the Coefficients\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen calculating time complexity, we don't concern ourselves with coefficients\n(the numbers that come before variables in mathematics, e.g. 2n or 5x).

Both of those procedures have a time\ncomplexity of O(n), since the minimum or maximum values could be at the end of\nthe array in the worst case. We could say that the time complexity of\nfind_lowest_and_highest is 2O(n), since the weakest link runs twice. However,\nBig O simply does not care about that, so we drop the coefficients and declare\nthat this function runs in O(n) time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eCommon Time Complexities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt's a lot easier to calculate Big O if you know how the most common runtimes\nare defined.

It can\nsort in place, i.e. it does not require us to push data to a new data structure,\nand it's typically implemented as a recursive algorithm. Note that there are a\nnumber of ways to implement a quicksort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/quicksort/quick_sort_partition_animation.gif\" alt=\"quicksort animation\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow Does Quicksort Work?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe quicksort algorithm requires us to choose a pivot element in the array. The\npivot can be at any point, such as the start, middle, or end. Next, we sort all\nof the elements that are less than the pivot to the left of the pivot, and all\nof the elements that are greater than the pivot to the right. Once this is done,\nthe pivot is at the correct location. We then repeat this process on the left\nand right sides until the whole list is sorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the diagram below, notice how the number 4, which is the pivot, is sorted to\nthe correct location before the recursive call is made (branching denotes the\nrecursive calls). First, we check if 1 is more than 4. It isn't so we move to\nthe next value: 7. 7 is more than 4, so it is swapped with the element before 4\n(which is 5), and 4 is then swapped with 7. This continues until every element\nbefore the pivot has been evaluated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/quicksort/quicksort_diagram.png\" alt=\"diagram of quicksort in action\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003ePerformance\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the worst case, quicksort runs in quadratic time: O(n^2). This will happen\nwhen we choose the rightmost element as the pivot for an already sorted list.\nThe average run time, however, is logarithmic: O(n log n).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can improve the performance of our quicksort algorithm by choosing the middle\nelement as the pivot instead. We can potentially gain further improvements by\nsampling three or more elements and choosing the median as the pivot. However,\nchoosing too many elements for sampling will likely degrade performance, so it\nreally is a balancing act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eImplement Quicksort\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe'll implement the quicksort algorithm in two parts. First we'll make the\nhelper function that sorts elements to the right or left of the pivot.

The last item on the stack is known as the \u003cstrong\u003etop\u003c/strong\u003e, and the first\nitem that was pushed on the stack is known as the \u003cstrong\u003ebase\u003c/strong\u003e.

If you are tackling a problem and you see that it must be solved\ndepth-first, this is a good clue that you'll either be using recursion or\nimplementing a stack.

Since\nDeirdre's last name starts with an \"X\", she'll probably be close to the end of\nthe phonebook. With iterative search, we can start at page 1 or the last page,\nand look at every page until we find \"Xanadu\". Starting at page 1 will be quick\nif there are barely any people whose last names start with the letters \"A\"\nthrough \"X\", and starting at the last page will only be quick if barely any\nresidents' last names start with letters \"Z\" through \"X\".

Let's say\nwe land on the page of \"Y\" names. \"X\" comes before \"Y\", so we take the part of\nthe book with \"M\" names up to the part with the \"Y\" names in our hands, find the\nmiddle and go there.

In code, however, we have to traverse the\nleft subtree and determine its depth, and then traverse the right subtree and\ndetermine its depth. Lastly, we compare those depths.

You can think\nof it as being similar to items in a kitchen cabinet: the items you use most\noften will likely be easy to see and within reach when you open the cupboard.\nThe items you use less often will be behind those items, and the items you use\nleast may be completely out of reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Use an LRU Cache?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe short story is that it's faster to read data from a cache (such as on the\nRAM) than it is to read it from a database or hard disk. Since there is a limit\nto how much data we can cache, we have to come up with a system to determine\nwhich data stays and which data gets evicted from the cache. With an LRU cache,\nwe evict the least recently used data once the cache is full. If you'd like the\nlong story, carry on reading this section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet's say we have a website where users can access many different stories. Our\nwebsite gets a lot of traffic, and each visit results in a request to the\ndatabase for a story. The responses to these requests are becoming slower and\nslower since accessing the database is expensive. We look at which stories our\nusers are accessing most often and notice that there are 10 stories that most\nusers access and those specific stories shift over time, i.e. the popular\nstories at 5PM differ from the popular stories at 10PM. This means we can cache\nthis data, or these stories, on the server. When we do this, requests for these\nstories will not result in database requests. Instead, they will be quickly\nretrieved directly from the server's memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe decide to implement an LRU cache! When a user makes a request for a story, we\ncheck if it's in the cache. If it is, we respond with that story and reorder the\ndata in our cache to reflect that the story was the most recently accessed. If\nthe story isn't in the cache, we make the request to the database, and then\nplace the story in the correct place within the LRU cache. If the cache is full,\nwe also remove the least recently accessed story from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eTrade Offs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe typical design of an LRU cache allows for extremely fast access: checking if\nan item is in the cache is a constant time O(1) operation. Updating the cache is\nalso extremely fast: O(1).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the trade off is the amount of space required to store the data. An LRU\ncache often uses two data structures — a doubly linked list and hash map — to\nstore the data in the correct order. This means it takes up more space than\nusing a simpler data structure, such as an Array. Note that it is possible to\nimplement an LRU cache with different data structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Two Data Structures?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe LRU cache requires its data to be ordered. It also requires fast access and\nupdating (insertion and deletion). Let's say we used an Array, since it's\nordered. We only have fast access if we know the index of the element we're\nlooking for in the Array, and our program is unlikely to have that information.\nSimilarly, inserting elements at the front of an Array is an O(n) operation, so\nwe can't use an Array for an LRU cache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe could also think about using a hash/object, but hashes are not ordered, so we\nhave another problem here. However, they do provide O(1) access when you know\nthe key for the value you're looking for. It is also extremely fast to add and\nremove key-value pairs from a Hash. We could also think about using a doubly\nlinked list (a doubly linked lists contains nodes that point to the next node\nand previous node). Linked lists are ordered and they allow for fast insertion\nand deletion. However, finding a specific item takes O(n) time, since we must\ntraverse the list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we combine a hash with a doubly linked list, we get the best of both\nworlds: constant-time access, insertion, and deletion! (As long as we design\nour LRU cache properly, that is.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow Do We Combine These Data Structures?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/lru-cache/lru_cache.svg\" alt=\"LRU Cache\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt's easier to think about how these data structures work together if we first\nset up some rules:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen we check if an item is in the cache, we always check if it's in the hash\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA key in the hash always points to a node in the doubly linked list\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eItems in the doubly linked list are always ordered from most recently used (at\nthe head) to least recently used (at the tail)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf an item is being added to a cache that's full, the least recently used item\nis removed from both the hash and list (at the tail)\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe list tells us which item was least recently used since it will always be\nat the tail\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf an item is being retrieved from the cache, it is moved to the head of the\nlist and the hash remains unchanged\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet's say we start with an empty cache. We want the recipe associated with an\nitem that has an ID of \"cake\". First, we check if \"cake\" is in the cache by\nasking the hash if it has a key of \"cake\". The cache is empty, so the data is\nretrieved from the database. Next, the LRU cache creates a new node, which\nstores the recipe. The node is added to the doubly linked list as its head and\ntail since the list contains only one item. Next, a key of \"cake\" is added to\nthe hash, and its value is set to the node that was just created. At the end of\nthis operation we have a list with a single node in it, and a hash with a key of\n\"cake\" pointing to that node.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"highlight plaintext\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003elru_cache.hash\n=\u0026gt; {\n  \"cake\": Node storing \"cake\"s recipe\n}\n\nlru_cache.list\n=\u0026gt; Doubly Linked List with head and tail both pointing to \"cake\" recipe Node\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow another user comes along asking for \"cake\".

And Facebook uses a\ngraph database instead of a relational database because it performs better for\ntheir use case, which is all about representing relationships between people,\nplaces, and other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are other use cases for graphs, but we'll let you Google those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eKey Terms\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNode / vertex: A point on the graph, similar to a node in a tree\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEdge: A connection or path between two points, which we can visualize as a\nline connecting two nodes, such as the line/edge from Anne to Bob in the image\nat the top of this README\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdjacency: Two nodes or vertices are adjacent if they are connected by an edge\n(e.g. Anne and Bob are adjacent)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePath: A sequence of edges between two points, similar to plotting a route from\nyour favorite bakery to your home (a path from Anne to Carl: Anne -\u0026gt; Bob -\u0026gt;\nCarl)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eTypes of Graphs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are several different types of graphs.

Or we can use a hash (object in JS, dictionary in\nPython...) or a multi-dimensional array as the underlying data structure. In\nthis challenge, we'll be creating our own Graph class using a hash/object as the\nunderlying data structure.

At this point,\nthey'll likely require that most or all problems be solved and will also\nconsider the quality of the solution/s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring synchronous interviews, the interviewer is likely looking to see how you:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWork in a team\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHandle feedback\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTalk technically\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHandle obstacles\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApproach solving a problem / think\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEvaluate different approaches to solving a problem and make decisions\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt this stage, you may be able to move forward in the hiring process if you\ndemonstrate good communication skills, logical thinking, perseverance, calm\nunder pressure, and graciousness towards your interviewer's feedback even if you\nare unable to solve the problem. Asking good questions to fully understand the\nproblem or get unstuck are normally welcome. Interviewers also typically expect\nyou to come up with your own test cases to ensure the problem is actually\nsolved. This portion of the interview might require you to largely solve the\nproblem alone on a whiteboard or IDE, or through pair programming where the\ninterviewer is either the driver or navigator. Many interviewers are forgiving\nof syntax errors, and they generally don't expect you to have every piece of the\ncore language memorized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this portion of the course, we will be preparing you for both types of\ninterviews, so it's important to take the time to solve as many problems as you\ncan alone and to complete the paired assignments, if applicable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to Progress Through This Section\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recommend approaching these problems in order by yourself since each problem\nincreases in difficulty. For a problem that is meant to be solved on the same\nday, work on it for 30 minutes. If you can't solve it in 30 minutes, work on\nsomething else, and then come back to it and give yourself up to 30 more\nminutes. For problems that are meant to be solved over the course of several\ndays, set aside 30 to 60 minutes each day to work on them. If you reach the time\nlimit and have not solved the problem, look at our solution or someone else's\nand take time to understand why it works. Some days, due to your workload, you\nmay need to set a shorter time limit; we recommend a minimum of 20 minutes\ntotal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you fall behind, e.g. you didn't solve Week 1 Day 2's problem on time, keep\nin mind that we usually have bonus problems and spare time available in Week 3\nof any Phase. You can always use this time to catch up on problems you missed.\nDon't worry if you don't finish all of the problems before the next Phase, you\ncan always come back to them when you have time or even after graduation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor any type of problem, if you were able to pass most of the test cases but\njust can't quite solve a couple of the edge cases, consider looking for a\nsolution to compare yours to. If we provide a solution, you can compare it to\nours, but you can also ask other students and search the Internet. Take the time\nto understand why the solutions work and consider working on your solution until\nit works given what you've learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSome Things to Keep in Mind\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou may struggle with some or many of these problems. Be patient with yourself\nand trust that with time and practice, you'll improve. You'll be amazed at how\nmuch you progress with each week or month!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you look at others' solutions, be aware that shorter doesn't mean better. Aim\nfor a solution that makes sense to you, which you can also explain to others.\nThree lines of easy-to-understand code is better than one line of confusing\ncode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you use an online platform that provides information on how fast your code\nruns or how well it utilizes memory, take that information with a giant grain of\nsalt. Many of those platforms do not tell you how they arrive at those results,\nand you may find that the results vary greatly even when running the same code.\nYou might also find that someone with a similar solution to yours has wildly\ndifferent performance results - an indication that the platform isn't\ncalculating results correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, try not to compare yourself to others at this point. Everyone progresses\nat a different pace, and that's OK. The key is to keep trying while taking care\nof yourself mentally and physically.\u003c/p\u003e","frontPage":false},{"exportId":"day-5-big-o-set-quiz","title":"Day 5: Big O Set Quiz","type":"WikiPage","content":"\u003cdiv id=\"git-data-element\" data-org=\"learn-co-curriculum\" data-repo=\"big-o-set-quiz\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cheader class=\"fis-header\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"fis-fork-link\" id=\"fork-link\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg id=\"fork-img\" title=\"Fork This Assignment\" alt=\"Fork This Assignment\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca class=\"fis-git-link\" href=\"https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/big-o-set-quiz\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg id=\"repo-img\" title=\"Open GitHub Repo\" alt=\"GitHub Repo\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca class=\"fis-git-link\" href=\"https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/big-o-set-quiz/issues/new\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg id=\"issue-img\" title=\"Create New Issue\" alt=\"Create New Issue\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/header\u003e  \u003cp\u003eIn this quiz we'll ask you to calculate the time complexity for several of the MySet class methods.

The space complexity is constant. It doesn't matter if \u003ccode\u003en\u003c/code\u003e is 0 or 100, this algorithm always relies on the same amount of data: an integer input, an array with two elements, and a variable to track the iterations. \u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eTime: O(n), Space: O(n)  \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003eNot quite.

We might think about which solution is easier to code or understand,\nbut we could also think about which solution runs faster. That last case is\nwhere Big O notation (calculating time complexity) comes in!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Big O Notation?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBig O notation describes the amount of time it takes for a procedure to run\nrelative to its input. For example, if the input is a string of one character:\nhow long will it take? If the input is 1,000 characters, how long then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt describes the runtime abstractly in terms of the input size and the number of\noperations that will occur, rather than milliseconds or other units of time.\nSpecifically, it describes the way in which the runtime grows as the input\ngrows. Here are some examples of what Big O notation looks like: O(n), O(1),\nO(n\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e). We'll get into what this means in a moment. For now, know that\nn refers to the size of the input or the input itself, e.g. the length of a\nstring or an array or a value itself, such as an integer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eCalculate for the Worst Case\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we get technical, let's use going to the grocery store as an analogy for\ncalculating time complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eGrocery Store\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo we're at the store looking for chocolate chips. The best case is that we walk\nin, and BAM, those chocolate chips are right there in front of us. The worst\ncase is that we end up walking up and down every single aisle, until finally we\nfind them. That last case is what we're interested in, and we could then\ndescribe our chocolate chip search in terms of the number of aisles in the\ngrocery store: O(aisles), because our search time grows as the number of aisles\ngrows. In other words, the amount of time it takes to find chocolatey morsels of\ngoodness depends on the number of aisles in the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf there were 5 aisles, we could say O(5), but what if the grocery store added\nor removed aisles? We'd have to update our notation to the new value, e.g.\nO(20). This is why it's better to say O(aisles): it covers any number of aisles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eFinding an Element in an Array\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet's say we have an unsorted array of elements and our function needs to find\nand return a specific element. That element could be at the 0th index or it\ncould be at the last index or not in there at all, so we iterate over the array\nuntil we find it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"highlight plaintext\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003efunction findElement(arr, target):\n  iterate over arr:\n    if element == target:\n      return true\n\n  return false\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe're interested in the worst case, which is when the element is not in the\narray. In that case we must iterate over the entire array before returning\nfalse. We can refer to the number of elements as n, which means Big O for this\nfunction is O(n). The time it takes to run directly relates to the array's\nlength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eCalculate for the Weakest Link\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBig O does not concern itself with every little detail in a procedure. Instead,\nit cares most about the part of the procedure that will take the longest. In\nother words, we find the part that will take the longest (the weakest link) and\ncalculate Big O for that part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eGrocery Store\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet's think back to our chocolate chip hunt. We discussed walking the aisles to\nsearch for those sweet nuggets, but we didn't talk about going to the store or\nwalking home. Let's pretend we live one minute away from the store, so walking\nthere always takes one minute. The time it takes to walk the aisles, on the\nother hand, depends on where the chocolate chips are. We don't need to concern\nourselves with the time it takes to walk because it's not the weakest link: it's\nalways the same amount of time. Walking the aisles is the weakest link because\nit has the potential to take up the most time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eFinding a Duplicate Element in an Array\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet's say we need to check if there's a duplicate of the 0th element in an array\nelsewhere in that same array.

The weakest link is the iteration over the\narray, which depends on the length of the array, so it has the potential to take\nup the most time. If the array is one element long: great, it'll be super fast.\nBut if it contains one million elements, that's going to take some time. Since\nthe amount of time directly correlates with the length of the array (which we\ncall n), Big O for this algorithm is O(n).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDrop the Coefficients\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen calculating time complexity, we don't concern ourselves with coefficients\n(the numbers that come before variables in mathematics, e.g. 2n or 5x).

Both of those procedures have a time\ncomplexity of O(n), since the minimum or maximum values could be at the end of\nthe array in the worst case. We could say that the time complexity of\nfind_lowest_and_highest is 2O(n), since the weakest link runs twice. However,\nBig O simply does not care about that, so we drop the coefficients and declare\nthat this function runs in O(n) time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eCommon Time Complexities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt's a lot easier to calculate Big O if you know how the most common runtimes\nare defined.

Learning\nhow to break apart a problem into pieces you can understand and then code a\nsolution for is a vital skill, as is learning to think about the different types\nof inputs - or test cases - your solution must account for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you grow as a developer, you'll find yourself leaning on these skills more\nand more, especially as your work becomes more challenging. These skills will\ntruly help you in any and every project you take on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to Solve a Problem\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTwo mistakes many programmers make are to jump into code too fast or to start\nthinking about code optimization too early. Both of these mistakes can greatly\nincrease the amount of time it takes to solve a problem and increase\nfrustration. To avoid this, here are the steps we recommend taking:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e1. Spend Time Understanding the Problem\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you dive into solving the problem, take the time to read it and describe\nit in your own words. You might find it useful to rewrite the problem before\nmoving on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have been given test cases, look at each one, apply your understanding of\nthe problem to them to determine what the answer is, and then check if your\nanswer matches the actual answer (e.g. work it out on paper or in your head, no\ncode necessary here). If your answer doesn't match, you need to spend more time\nunderstanding the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e2. Write Your Own Test Cases\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you understand the problem and why the answers to the test cases are\nwhat they are, you're ready to write your own test cases! We are not\nrecommending that you write test suites in Rspec or Jest. Instead, you simply\nprint the result of calling your solution method and compare it to the answer\nyou expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBe aware that algorithm problem descriptions rarely provide all of the test\ncases you need to account for, so it's incredibly important that you also come\nup with your own. This is true when using online platforms, such as Leetcode and\nHackerRank, as well as during interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e3. Pseudocode\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRemember how we asked you to check your understanding of the problem by going\nthrough the test cases and then writing your own tests? Congratulations! This\nmeans that on some level, you know how to solve the problem. Before you start\ncoding, write pseudocode, which is just a plain description of how to solve the\nproblem. For example, the pseudocode for copying only numbers from one array to\nanother might look like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre class=\"highlight plaintext\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003einitialize empty array called result\n\niterate over each item in the input array:\n  if element is a number:\n    push item onto result\n\nreturn result\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that different people write pseudocode differently. The key is to make it\neasy to understand yourself and explain to others - this is the map to the code\nyou're about to write! I often paste my pseudocode into my workspace as\ncomments, and then code each piece alongside the matching comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also test this procedure against the test cases before writing any code.\nValidating and rewriting pseudocode will likely save you time. You might also\nwish to think about additional solutions: there's always more than one way to\nsolve a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e4. Code!\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that you have a map, convert it to code!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, the goal is to make it work: pass those test cases! If you're\nhaving a hard time getting all of the test cases working, check that your\npseudocode actually solves for all of those cases and then check that your code\ndoes what the pseudocode says it should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e5. Make It Clean and Readable\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce your solution is well, a solution, it's time to refactor your code so that\nit's easy to read, not just for you but also for others. Use well-named\nvariables and convert blocks of code to methods when necessary. If you find any\nunneeded or redundant code, delete it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDon't forget to test your code again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e6. Optimize?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDon't optimize your code for time or space complexity (e.g. how long it takes to\nrun or how much memory it's using) unless you absolutely need to. There are\nthree major situations that call for optimization:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe solution is hanging on certain test cases, and therefore cannot pass since\nit's taking too long\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou were asked to do so\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou think it would be fun to try\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe hope these steps help you solve the problems you're about to encounter.\nRemember, they can be applied to all types of problems, including building web\napps.

Mostly, orders are removed from the front of the Queue and added to the end of the Queue. This means we should optimize for fast insertion at the rear and fast removal from the front.

It can\nsort in place, i.e. it does not require us to push data to a new data structure,\nand it's typically implemented as a recursive algorithm. Note that there are a\nnumber of ways to implement a quicksort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/quicksort/quick_sort_partition_animation.gif\" alt=\"quicksort animation\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow Does Quicksort Work?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe quicksort algorithm requires us to choose a pivot element in the array. The\npivot can be at any point, such as the start, middle, or end. Next, we sort all\nof the elements that are less than the pivot to the left of the pivot, and all\nof the elements that are greater than the pivot to the right. Once this is done,\nthe pivot is at the correct location. We then repeat this process on the left\nand right sides until the whole list is sorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the diagram below, notice how the number 4, which is the pivot, is sorted to\nthe correct location before the recursive call is made (branching denotes the\nrecursive calls). First, we check if 1 is more than 4. It isn't so we move to\nthe next value: 7. 7 is more than 4, so it is swapped with the element before 4\n(which is 5), and 4 is then swapped with 7. This continues until every element\nbefore the pivot has been evaluated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/quicksort/quicksort_diagram.png\" alt=\"diagram of quicksort in action\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003ePerformance\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the worst case, quicksort runs in quadratic time: O(n^2). This will happen\nwhen we choose the rightmost element as the pivot for an already sorted list.\nThe average run time, however, is logarithmic: O(n log n).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can improve the performance of our quicksort algorithm by choosing the middle\nelement as the pivot instead. We can potentially gain further improvements by\nsampling three or more elements and choosing the median as the pivot. However,\nchoosing too many elements for sampling will likely degrade performance, so it\nreally is a balancing act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eImplement Quicksort\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe'll implement the quicksort algorithm in two parts. First we'll make the\nhelper function that sorts elements to the right or left of the pivot.

Or we can use a hash (object in JS, dictionary in\nPython...) or a multi-dimensional array as the underlying data structure. In\nthis challenge, we'll be creating our own Graph class using a hash/object as the\nunderlying data structure. The key will be to maintain the rules of the graph,\nor as we prefer to say its \"graphiness\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe suggest you read more about the different methods for representing a graph.\nTry Googling \"adjacency matrix\" to get yourself started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOur Graph\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday we'll be creating a Graph class that uses a hash/object as the underlying\ndata structure.

But, when it comes to trees, we actually\nhave a more specific definition of height and it can be measured numerically,\njust like your own height!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/balanced-binary-tree/tree_height.png\" alt=\"Tree height\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a binary tree, the height is defined as the distance from the root node\n(where the tree starts) to the furthest leaf node (a node without any children).\nTo calculate the height we count up the layers (or depth) of nodes (not all of\nthe nodes), and then subtract 1, since we aren't supposed to include the root\nnode in the height. This means that the height for both trees in the image at\nthe top of this reading is 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to Determine If a Tree Is Balanced or Unbalanced\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA tree is considered balanced if its right subtree and left subtree are the same\nheight or they have a difference of 1. All other trees are unbalanced.

We\nlook at the left and right sides and can almost immediately tell that they're\nthe same, or roughly the same, height. In code, however, we have to traverse the\nleft subtree and determine its depth, and then traverse the right subtree and\ndetermine its depth. Lastly, we compare those depths. We won't be coding this\ntoday, but we will be revisiting this in a later challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Should We Balance a Tree?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/balanced-binary-tree/tree_compare.png\" alt=\"Two trees to compare\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTake a look at the two trees above.

Think about what the\nspecific run time might be, or Google it. (Hint: does this remind you the binary\nsearch algorithm?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the right tree, which is unbalanced, we have to visit every single node\nbefore we get to 16. This has a Big O run time of O(n), which is not as good as\nthe balanced tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo why do we want to aim for balanced trees?

We'll include\nseveral methods in the starter files which you'll fill out. For each method,\nreturn the root node. Our tests will then check if the tree is balanced or\nunbalanced, and if it's a valid BST. Remember, a tree is balanced if the left\nand right subtrees have a height difference of 0 or 1.

Similar to a stack of pancakes, where the last pancake placed on\nthe stack is eaten first, the last item placed on the stack data structure is\nremoved first. The last item on the stack is known as the \u003cstrong\u003etop\u003c/strong\u003e, and the first\nitem that was pushed on the stack is known as the \u003cstrong\u003ebase\u003c/strong\u003e.

We also think of recursive\nproblems in terms of a stack, since each recursive call results in a stack frame\nbeing added to the stack: those frames are then processed and removed in LIFO\norder! If you are tackling a problem and you see that it must be solved\ndepth-first, this is a good clue that you'll either be using recursion or\nimplementing a stack. Depth-first means that we go as deep as we can before we\nstart processing data (LIFO order).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWait!

Since\nDeirdre's last name starts with an \"X\", she'll probably be close to the end of\nthe phonebook. With iterative search, we can start at page 1 or the last page,\nand look at every page until we find \"Xanadu\". Starting at page 1 will be quick\nif there are barely any people whose last names start with the letters \"A\"\nthrough \"X\", and starting at the last page will only be quick if barely any\nresidents' last names start with letters \"Z\" through \"X\". In the worst case,\nDeirdre will be on the last page or first page, depending on where we start our\nsearch, and we will have visited every page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/binary-search/binary_search.gif\" alt=\"Binary Search\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow let's use a binary search.

Let's say the last names on this page start\nwith \"M\". \"M\" comes before \"X\", so we take the second half of the book in our\nhands, locate the middle page of that portion, and go straight there. Let's say\nwe land on the page of \"Y\" names. \"X\" comes before \"Y\", so we take the part of\nthe book with \"M\" names up to the part with the \"Y\" names in our hands, find the\nmiddle and go there.

We then check if the target\nvalue we're searching for is less or more than the middle. If the target is less\nthan the middle value, we search the left side.

Today we'll be focusing on a type of traversal called\nlevel-order or breadth-first tree traversal, which can be used with any type of\ntree data structure. Typically, it is implemented iteratively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/level-order-tree-traversal/trees.png\" alt=\"Trees\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is level-order tree traversal?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith level-order traversal we start at the root and then move down the tree one\nlevel, or layer, at a time. You can think of it as being similar to a printer:\nit outputs its ink in rows until the image is complete. You can also think of it\nas being similar to typing a document: you type one line going from left to\nright, and then move down to the next and repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTake a moment to look at the trees at the top of this README. If we were to\nperform a level-order traversal of the left tree and print out each value, we\nwould get: 10, 5, 12, 3, 6, 16. For the tree on the right: 5, 30, 60.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eBut Why?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet's say we had our data stored in a tree, but it wasn't a binary search tree\n(a BST requires its nodes to be ordered).

On the left side or the right side. If we do a\nlevel-order traversal (breadth-first search aka BFS), we can stop searching once\nwe reach the correct depth.

You can think\nof it as being similar to items in a kitchen cabinet: the items you use most\noften will likely be easy to see and within reach when you open the cupboard.\nThe items you use less often will be behind those items, and the items you use\nleast may be completely out of reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Use an LRU Cache?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe short story is that it's faster to read data from a cache (such as on the\nRAM) than it is to read it from a database or hard disk. Since there is a limit\nto how much data we can cache, we have to come up with a system to determine\nwhich data stays and which data gets evicted from the cache. With an LRU cache,\nwe evict the least recently used data once the cache is full. If you'd like the\nlong story, carry on reading this section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet's say we have a website where users can access many different stories. Our\nwebsite gets a lot of traffic, and each visit results in a request to the\ndatabase for a story. The responses to these requests are becoming slower and\nslower since accessing the database is expensive. We look at which stories our\nusers are accessing most often and notice that there are 10 stories that most\nusers access and those specific stories shift over time, i.e. the popular\nstories at 5PM differ from the popular stories at 10PM. This means we can cache\nthis data, or these stories, on the server. When we do this, requests for these\nstories will not result in database requests. Instead, they will be quickly\nretrieved directly from the server's memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe decide to implement an LRU cache! When a user makes a request for a story, we\ncheck if it's in the cache. If it is, we respond with that story and reorder the\ndata in our cache to reflect that the story was the most recently accessed. If\nthe story isn't in the cache, we make the request to the database, and then\nplace the story in the correct place within the LRU cache. If the cache is full,\nwe also remove the least recently accessed story from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eTrade Offs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe typical design of an LRU cache allows for extremely fast access: checking if\nan item is in the cache is a constant time O(1) operation. Updating the cache is\nalso extremely fast: O(1).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the trade off is the amount of space required to store the data. An LRU\ncache often uses two data structures — a doubly linked list and hash map — to\nstore the data in the correct order. This means it takes up more space than\nusing a simpler data structure, such as an Array. Note that it is possible to\nimplement an LRU cache with different data structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Two Data Structures?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe LRU cache requires its data to be ordered. It also requires fast access and\nupdating (insertion and deletion). Let's say we used an Array, since it's\nordered. We only have fast access if we know the index of the element we're\nlooking for in the Array, and our program is unlikely to have that information.\nSimilarly, inserting elements at the front of an Array is an O(n) operation, so\nwe can't use an Array for an LRU cache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe could also think about using a hash/object, but hashes are not ordered, so we\nhave another problem here. However, they do provide O(1) access when you know\nthe key for the value you're looking for. It is also extremely fast to add and\nremove key-value pairs from a Hash. We could also think about using a doubly\nlinked list (a doubly linked lists contains nodes that point to the next node\nand previous node). Linked lists are ordered and they allow for fast insertion\nand deletion. However, finding a specific item takes O(n) time, since we must\ntraverse the list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we combine a hash with a doubly linked list, we get the best of both\nworlds: constant-time access, insertion, and deletion!

The cache is empty, so the data is\nretrieved from the database. Next, the LRU cache creates a new node, which\nstores the recipe. The node is added to the doubly linked list as its head and\ntail since the list contains only one item. Next, a key of \"cake\" is added to\nthe hash, and its value is set to the node that was just created.
